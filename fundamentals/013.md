# Client-side routing with HTML5

- `pushState` allows JavaScript to update the browser url
- Uses proper URLs

Go to:

```http
http://www.myawesomewebsite.com/users/1

```

From:

```http
http://www.myawesomewebsite.com/register
```

Without reloading the page. The React can get the current URL and render the components like if it was got another page redered in the server side.

- Requires a browser that supports `pushState`

## Client-side routing with Hash Fragment

- Another alternative is use the # (hash fragment) that points to page sections. React can render only the selected page fragment and shows the other after a link be clicked.
