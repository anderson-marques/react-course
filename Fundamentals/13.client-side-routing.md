# Client-side routing with HTML5
- `pushState` allows JavaScript to update the browser url
- Uses proper URLs

Go to: 
```http
http://www.myawesomewebsite.com/users/1

```
From: 
```http
http://www.myawesomewebsite.com/register
```

Without reloading the page. The React can get the current URL and render the components like if it was got another page redered in the server side. 

- Requires a browser that supports `pushState`
